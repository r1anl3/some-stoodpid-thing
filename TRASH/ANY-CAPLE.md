# Ôn tập Thiết kế mạng
- **Chương 1**
    - OSI model: 7 tầng
        - Segment: A single network bounded by a switch or router and based on a particular Layer 1 and Layer 2 protocol such as Fast Ethernet.
        - LAN: A set of switched segments based on a particular Layer 2 protocol such as Fast Ethernet and an interswitch trunking protocol such as the IEEE 802.1Q standard.
        - Building network: Multiple LANs within a building, usually connected to a building backbone network.
        - Campus network: Multiple buildings within a local geographical area (within a few miles), usually connected to a campus-backbone network.


    - SDLC: 
        - Plan:  Network requirements are identified in this phase. This phase also includes an analysis of areas where the network will be installed and an identification of users who will require network services.
        - Design: In this phase, the network designers accomplish the bulk of the logical and physical design, according to requirements gathered during the plan phase.
        - Implement: After the design has been approved, implementation begins. The network is built according to the design specifications. Implementation also serves to verify the design.
        -  Operate: Operation is the final test of the effectiveness of the design. The network is monitored during this phase for performance problems and any faults to provide input into the optimize phase of the network life cycle.
        - Optimize:  The optimize phase may lead to a network redesign if too many problems arise because of design errors or as network performance degrades over time as actual use and capabilities diverge. Redesign can also be required when requirements change significantly
        - Retire: When the network, or a part of the network, is out-of-date, it might be taken out of production. Although Retire is not incorporated into the name of the life cycle(PDIOO), it is nonetheless an important phase. The retire phase wraps around to the plan phase. The PDIOO life cycle repeats as network requirements evolve.

    - Tính sẵn sàng: `Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)`
    - Giải thích ký hiệu:
        - MTBF: mean time between failure/thời gian không lỗi
        - MTTR: mean time to repair/thời gian sửa lỗi
    - Đánh giá hiệu năng:
        - Capacity(bandwith): khả năng truyền dữ liệu, tính bằng bps.
        - Utilization(khả năng sử dụng): phần trăm **capacity** được đang sử dụng.
        - Optimum ultilization(khả năng sử dụng tối đa): trung bình lớn nhất của **utilization**.
        - Throughput(thông lượng): lượng data truyền đi không lỗi trong khoảng thời gian.
        - Offered load: tổng data của các node trong mạng.
        - Accuracy: độ chính xác, liên quan tới các traffic.
        - Efficiency: độ hiệu quả
        ...
    - Bốn nguồn gây trễ gói tin:
        $d_{nodal} = d_{proc} + d_{queue} + d_{trans} + d_{prop} $
        - $d_{proc}$: xử lí tại nút
        - $d_{queue}$: xếp hàng
        - $d_{trans}$: truyền, 
            $d_{trans} = \text{chiều dài gói tin(bits) / băng thông liên kết(bps)}$
        - $d_{prop}$: lan truyền,
            $d_{prop} = \text{độ dài đường liên kết vật lí(m)/tốc độ lan truyền(m/s)}$
        - Queuing delay and bandwidth utilization:
            `queue depth = utilization/(1-utilization)`
            Ex:  A packet switch has **five** users, each offering packets at a rate of **10 bps**. The average length of the packets is **1024 bits**. The packet switch needs to transmit this data over a **56-kbps** WAN circuit.
            - Load $= 5 \times 10 \times 1024 = 51,200 (bps)$.
            - Utilization $= \frac{51,200}{56,000}= 91.4 \% $
            - Avg packets in queue $= \frac{0.914}{1-0.914} = 10.63 (packets)$
- **Chương 3**
    - Data link layer map includes:
        - An indication of the data link layer technology for WANs and LANs (Frame Relay, Point-to-Point Protocol [PPP], VPN, 100-Mbps or 1000-Mbps Ethernet, and so on)
        - The name of the service provider for WANs
        - WAN circuit IDs
        - The location and high-level configuration information for LAN switches (for example, the location of the desired root bridge if the Spanning Tree Protocol [STP] is used)
        - The location and reach of any VLANs and VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) configurations
        - The location and high-level configuration of trunks between LAN switches
        - The location and high-level configuration of any Layer 2 firewalls
    - Naming network element:
        - Airport code styles: `San Francisco = SFO, Oakland = OAK,...`
        - Standard naming systems: `DNS, for IP networks, or NetBIOS Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) on Windows networks`
    - Wireless installation:
        - Reflection/Phản xạ: Reflection causes the signal to bounce back on itself. The signal can interfere with itself in the air and affect the receiver’s ability to discriminate between the signal and noise in the environment. Reflection is caused by metal surfaces such as steel girders, scaffolding, shelving units, steel pillars, and metal doors. Implementing a Wireless LAN (WLAN) across a parking lot can be tricky because of metal cars that come and go.
        - Absorption/Hấp thụ: Some of the electromagnetic energy of the signal can be absorbed by the material in objects through which it passes, resulting in a reduced signal level. Water has significant absorption properties, and objects such as trees or thick wooden structures can have a high water content. Implementing a WLAN in a coffee shop can be tricky if there are large canisters of liquid coffee. Coffee-shop WLAN users have also noticed that people coming and going can affect the signal level. (On StarTrek, a non-human character once called a human “an ugly giant bag of mostly water”!)
        - Refraction/Khúc xạ: When an RF signal passes from a medium with one density into a medium with another density, the signal can be bent, much like light passing through a prism. The signal changes direction and may interfere with the non-refracted signal. It can take a different path and encounter other, unexpected obstructions, and arrive at recipients damaged or later than expected. As an example, a water tank not only introduces absorption, but the difference in density between the atmosphere and the water can bend the RF signal.
        - Diffraction/Nhiễu xạ: Diffraction, which is similar to refraction, results when a region through which the RF signal can pass easily is adjacent to a region in which reflective obstructions exist. Like refraction, the RF signal is bent around the edge of the diffractive region and can then interfere with that part of the RF signal that is not bent.
    - Network healthcheck:
        - Performance: peak load
        - Availability: MTBF, MTTR
        - Network utilization: time
        - Bandwidth utilization: **absolute usage** specifies how much bandwidth is used by the protocol in comparison to the total capacity of the segment (for example, in comparison to 100 Mbps on Fast Ethernet)
        - Accuracy: bit error rate test(BERT), CRC
        - Switch ethernet networks: CSMA/CD
        - Efficiency: maximum transmission unit(MTU)
        - Delay and response time: round-trip time (RTT)
        - Status routers, switches, firewalls: CISCO commands

    - Traffic flow for network app:
        - Terminal/Host: asysmmetric. The terminal sends a few characters and the host sends many characters.
        - Client/Server: most widely used. 
            - Clients send queries and requests to a server. The server responds with data or permission for the client to send data. 
            - The flow is usually **bidirectional** and **asymmetric**. 
            - Requests from the client are typically small frames, except when writing data to the server, in which case they are larger. 
            - Responses from the server range from **64 bytes to 1500 bytes or more**, depending on the maximum frame size allowed for the data link layer in use.
            - Include: Server Message Block (SMB), Network File System (NFS), Apple Filing Protocol (AFP), and NetWare Core Protocol (NCP)
        - Thin Client:
            - A special case of Client/Server, simple.
            - With thin client technology (also known as server-based computing), user applications originate on a central server. In some cases, the application runs on the central server, and in other cases, the software is installed on the server and is downloaded into the client machine for execution.
            - Advantage: Lower support costs.
            - Disadvantage:  the amount of data flowing from the server to the client can be substantial(lớn)
        - Peer-to-Peer:
            - **bidirectional and symmetric**
            - Each host acts as both a client and server.
            - Use: downloading
        - Server/Server:
            - Servers talk to other servers to implement directory services, to cache heavily used data, to mirror data for load balancing and redundancy, to back up data, and to broadcast service availability
            - Bidrectional
        - Distribute computing:
            - Require multiple computing nodes working together to complete a job.
